Okay, settle in, little one. Let me tell you a story about a tiny firefly named Pip. 
Pip wasn’t like the other fireflies in Meadowbrook. They all had brilliant, dazzling lights – like tiny, twinkling stars. 
But Pip’s light... well, it was a little... shy. It was a gentle, soft glow, barely brighter than a candle flame. 
The other fireflies would zoom and flash, showing off their spectacular displays, while Pip just blinked quietly in the grass. 
He felt a little sad about it. He wanted to shine as brightly as the rest, but no matter how hard he tried, his light remained gentle. 
He’d hide amongst the clover, feeling a tiny prickle of disappointment. 
One evening, as the moon began to rise, a little lost badger cub named Barnaby stumbled into Meadowbrook. 
Barnaby was crying, his whiskers drooping with worry. He’d wandered away from his mama and couldn’t find his way back. 
All the other fireflies tried to help, flashing their brilliant lights, trying to guide him. 
But Barnaby was too scared, and the bright flashes just made him more frightened.  
Then, Pip, hiding amongst the clover, saw Barnaby’s distress. He took a deep breath and, bravely, he flew out from the shadows. 
He didn’t flash. He didn’t try to be dazzling. He just gently blinked his soft, warm light. 
Barnaby looked up and saw it.  The gentle light wasn’t overwhelming, but it was there, a comforting little beacon in the dark. 
He followed Pip’s light, slowly, carefully, until they reached his mama.  
Barnaby’s mama rushed over, scooping him up in a warm hug. 
She thanked Pip profusely, “Your light was just what I needed,” she whispered. “It was so calm and reassuring.” 
Pip felt a warmth spread through him that had nothing to do with his light. He realized something important.  
He didn’t need to be the brightest light in Meadowbrook. 
He had a special kind of light – a gentle, comforting light that could help someone in need.  
The other fireflies, seeing what Pip had done, gathered around him. They didn’t try to make his light brighter. 
Instead, they flickered their lights softly beside his, creating a beautiful, calming glow across the meadow.  
From that night on, Pip continued to blink his gentle light, helping lost creatures and comforting those who were sad.  
He learned that being different wasn’t a bad thing, and that sometimes, the smallest, most unassuming light can make the biggest difference.  
And you, little one, you too have a light. It might not be the brightest, but it’s yours, and it’s special.  
It’s the light of kindness, of compassion, and of love.  
Now close your eyes, breathe deeply, and let your light shine softly within you. Sweet dreams.
